# ap-replacepalms
Replaces all palm tree models and most California style plants (not LODs) with an invisible object, causing a less California city feel

If you want to add an additional model all you need to do is copy one of the files in the streaming folder and rename it to the object that you want to remove

**PALM TREES HAVE SEPARATE COLLISONS OUTSIDE OF THE MODEL, YOU WILL HAVE INIVISBLE OBJECTS**
